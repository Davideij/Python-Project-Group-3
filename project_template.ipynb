    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "After the end of WW2, many countries’ governments around the world believed cars and airplanes were the future of transport and invested heavily in airports and highways. While cars and planes are indeed useful forms of transportation and certainly have their places in the world economy, there exists another form of transportation which can transform and revitalize the cities and regions in which it’s built: high-speed rail. As a concept, high-speed rail (HSR) is not a new technology, yet the environment benefits and positive socio-economic externalities it can bring to communities are nothing short of extraordinary. Large reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, less congestion on roads and airplanes alike, and the spurring of development along corridors are just a few of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within the last few decades, many countries in Europe have chosen to create and expand their HSR networks, connecting populations with a faster, greener, and more convenient mode of travel. However, there are still major gaps in those networks, especially across international borders. And given the EU goal to become a climate-neutral economy by 2050, it is crucial for investments in high-speed rail to be carried out in a timely manner. The only question left to answer is where such systems should be built.\n"

    "As such, this report was created to try and answer this question:\n",
    "\n",
    "__- Which city-pairs in Europe could stand to benefit the most from a high-speed rail connection?__\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to this question would be based upon three main factors:\n",
    "    a.\tThe number of current air passengers. \n",
    "    b.\tThe distance between city centers.\n",
    "    c.\tThe metropolitan population of both cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, two sub-questions were devised to place and give better context to the main question:\n",
    "    1.\tWhich city pairs already have the highest number of air passengers?\n",
    "    2.\tWhich city pairs fall within the set distance range?\n",
