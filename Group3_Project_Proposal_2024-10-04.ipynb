    "Description: \n",
    "\n",
    "The data will be taken for 2016-2019. This timeframe was chosen to avoid the Covid-19 pandemic impacting the air travel data. For the geographical scope, we will use the five largest economies in the EU (The Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, Spain), Belgium and Luxembourg. These countries already have well developed train infrastructure and are likely to invest in further projects. \n",
